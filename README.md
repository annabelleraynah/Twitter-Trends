# Twitter-Trends
Twitter is a social media platform where users can post messages called tweets, follow or unfollow other users, and view tweets posted by other users. In today's world, Twitter has created a lot of controversy between people, with polarizing opinions about important issues coming to light. We want to explore the content of these tweets and understand relationships between the content of tweets. For instance, you might want to know what topic is popular (or trending) today, what content is considered offensive, and so on. In this project, we're going to analyze tweets and report results to users based on our analysis.
